# Random Projects

## Introduction

**Just random projects to get hands-on with various technologies and different languages. Trying to learn and implement new concepts like ML, AI etc.  
Few games which can be played in free time for entertainment. Not much importance given to UI / UX right now as they are just first iterations. Feel free to modify code anyway necessary and help with creating them better is appreciated.  
Fork the repository and enhance it and introduce new features.  
> HAVE FUN AND HAPPY CODING**
